This Repository contains two Physical Science Data Analysis Project

- K Means Clustering on Soil Moisture DataSet.

- Tableau and Excel Report about different Environment Performance Index(It shows how each country is performing environmentally by giving different indices to every country like Biodiversity, Air Quality)



##1)K Means Clustering on Soil Moisture Dataset.

- The dataset measures soil moisture over a 5 day period at a place in Germany. 
- Soil moisture is plotted against soil temperature which is on X-axis and then clustering algorithm is implemented. 
-After clustering we find 4 distinct clusters. 1)High Temperature - Low moisture. 2)Moderate Temperature - Moderate moisture 
 3)High Temperature - High Moisture.   4)Low Temperature - High Moisture.
-Code is available in the [KMeans_Soil_Moisture.ipynb](KMeans_Soil_Moisture.ipynb) file.
