# Environment-Data-Science
This Repository contains two Physical Science Data Analysis Project

- K Means Clustering on Soil Moisture DataSet.

- Tableau and Excel Report about different Environment Performance Index(It shows how each country is performing environmentally by giving different indices to every country like Biodiversity, Air Quality)



## 1)K Means Clustering on Soil Moisture Dataset.

- The dataset measures soil moisture over a 5 day period at a place in Germany. 
- Soil moisture is plotted against soil temperature which is on X-axis and then clustering algorithm is implemented. 
-After clustering we find 4 distinct clusters. 1)High Temperature - Low moisture. 2)Moderate Temperature - Moderate moisture 
 3)High Temperature - High Moisture.   4)Low Temperature - High Moisture.
-Code is available in the [KMeans_Soil_Moisture.ipynb](KMeans_Soil_Moisture.ipynb) file.


## 2)EPI(Environment Performance Index) Report using Tableau and Excel.

- The dataset contains different performance indices like Biodiversity, Air Quality, Water Sanitation etc.
- Based on these indices we get to know whether the country is environmentally performing well or not.
- For this project we will be focussing only on Biodiversity Indices. 
- There are 6 biodiversity indices namely MPA , TBN , TBG , SPI , SHR , PAR.

### 2.1) Excel Report
- [EPI_final.xlsx](EPI_final.xlsx) file contains the excel report which has countries and their 6 indices. 
- Red being the lowest index value and green being the highest. 
- The higher the index value the better. 
- You can slice the data by country in excel

### 2.2) Tableau Report
- On Tableau you can see data in maps, for different indices. 
- Only 4 indices are considered in Tableau - TBN , TBG , SHR , PAR.
- Red being the lower index value and Green being the highest.
- Refer the [Tableau_Dashboard](Tableau_Dashboard) file.
